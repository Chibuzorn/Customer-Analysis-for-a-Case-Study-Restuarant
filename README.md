# Customer-Analysis-for-a-Case-Study-Restuarant
This project and the data used is part of a weekly challenge which can he found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). It focuses on examining the patterns in sales and customer purchasing power of the items at the restuarant and to highligh potential areas on improvement in the menu or marketing startegies in the restuarant.

## **Background**
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## **Tools for Analysis**
- Visual Paradigm for Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD)
- Postgresql for the Exploratory Data Analysis

## **Problem Statement**
- Danny does not know what to do with the data he gets from his customers, so they keep coming back.
- Danny also needs some insights which will help him decide if he is to continue with his loyalty program
- Danny needs some basic datasets to be generated for him, so he can inspect them without the use of sql.
- Danny has provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for  to write fully functioning SQL queries to   help him answer his questions!
- Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study: sales, menu and members

## **Skills Applied**
- Aggregations
- JOINs
- CTEs
- scripts to generate basic reports 
## **Explortory Data Analysis**
- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
